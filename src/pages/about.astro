      <p>
        We are <strong>gamers</strong> first <em>(metalheads, second)</em>!
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Beyond the Fog Gate was created by people who genuinely love video
        games—from massive worlds like Elden Ring and the Dark Souls series to
        smaller, independent titles that often go unnoticed.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        This site exists for one simple reason: freedom.
        <br />
        Freedom to cover any game we believe is worth talking about, without artificial
        restrictions, trends, or hype cycles deciding what matters.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        We focus on honest coverage, thoughtful discussion, and giving space to
        games and creators who deserve attention—whether they are big releases
        or quiet indie projects.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">Everyone deserves a voice. This is ours.</p>
