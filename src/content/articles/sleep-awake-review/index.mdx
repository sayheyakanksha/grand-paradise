I'm going to level with you. Historically, I've not been a huge [horror](https://www.dualshockers.com/tag/horror/) gamer. I adore films in the genre, but for whatever reason, few of the heavy hitters in the gaming industry have ever grabbed me. As such, I'm not positive as to why I ultimately raised my hand for [Sleep Awake](https://www.dualshockers.com/psychedelic-horror-sleep-awake-official-trailer/), a truly disturbing-looking title that I really didn't know what to expect from going into it.

What was clear, however, was that Sleep Awake promised to be [visually striking](https://www.thegamer.com/most-visually-unique-graphics-games-ranked/), bizarre, and truly "out there," which are the types of movies in the horror sphere that I traditionally find to be my favorites. Combine this with Spec Ops: The Line director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck being the leads of this project, and it was enough to get me thoroughly intrigued to learn what this game truly was.

After the five or six-hour experience, I am _so_ glad that I signed up for the ride. Sleep Awake is an absolutely _riveting_ title full of crazy reveals, dream/nightmare-like art reels, and a world that I want to continue learning everything about that I possibly can.

I don't think this is a title that will hit for every type of gamer, particularly those who are dependent on some sort of combat-centric gameplay. But for those of us who are on board for an artsy trek into the unknown, the abstract, and the often unsettling, **Sleep Awake is such an incredibly easy recommendation to make**.

## **Incredible, Riveting World-Building**

Right off the bat, Sleep Awake's premise got me hook, line, and sinker. There won't be any spoilers here aside from the general setup, because there's something incredible about jumping into this one as blindly as possible. Main character Katja lives in a world where no one can fall asleep anymore.

Well, they c*an* fall asleep, but upon doing so, a mysterious entity referred to only as The Hush then has the ability to rip these dreamers away, leaving nothing but an ethereal outline of their body on the ground where they finally passed out for the final time. In a world such as this, the goal is immediately made clear: stay awake by any means necessary.

How this idea is fully fleshed out into an entire world instantly is **nothing short of a narrative masterclass**. Staying conscious perpetually, of course, has everyone in a state of psychosis, with many turning to religious cult-like dedications like worshiping pain or intense shock therapy simply to keep their eyes open. Others have to rely on _insanely_ side-effect-heavy drugs in order to keep their eyes peeled. There are, frankly, no good options here, and the world is _bleak_ as a result.

## Closing Comments

Sleep Awake is absolutely stunning visually and feels like walking through an art installation full of heavy themes and commentary. Combined with the impeccable soundscape crafted by Nine Inch Nails' Robin Finck and some of the best world-building I've ever experienced in a sub-10-hour video game, it's a title that will stick with me for a long time. Some occasional subpar stealth sections and an obtuse puzzle or two are the only blemishes on an otherwise incredible journey that had me riveted from start to finish, with a story and main character that were incredible to witness. I want more of this world and premise. I want a book. I want a movie. I'm not sure that I'll be able to sleep till I get it.
